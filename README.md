# Dynamic Model Updating (DMU): A short tutorial
Dynamic model updating (DMU) approach develops statistical models with missing data. DMU uses only the information available in the dataset to prepare the statistical models. The basic framework is to divide the dataset into smaller datasets containing a smaller number of predictors but complete information, and sequentially build the model for each dataset followed by updating the estimates of the predictors after each model.
